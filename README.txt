This project aims to identify the differences between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and determine which alleles or combination of alleles are most likely to cause diseases. For example:

If a case patient has:       and the control group has:
AA                                 AG
TT                                 TT
CG                                 CC
AG                                 AA
TA                                 TT

At the level of 5 SNPs, the case patient has 4 different combinations from SNPs 1, 3, 4, and 5. Throughout all cases, if 4 out of 5 show the highest difference compared to the control group, we consider this to be the typical pattern that might cause the disease. Of course, in comparisons involving 10 or 20 SNPs, the results become more accurate and promising.
